# Complete Geometric Pattern Model for Prime Number Prediction

This document provides a comprehensive overview of the complete geometric pattern model for prime number prediction, which combines direct geometric pattern detection with enhanced resonance verification.

## Overview

The model is based on the insight that prime numbers occupy specific geometric positions within cycles, metacycles, and systems of the UFRF dimensional structure. Resonance is used as a verification mechanism rather than the primary identification method.

## Key Components

### 1. Dimensional Structure
- Based on the UFRF framework formula: D_n = 13 × 2^(n-1)
- Each number is mapped to a position within this dimensional structure
- The structure is organized into:
  - Positions (1-13)
  - Cycles
  - Metacycles
  - System levels

### 2. Direct Geometric Pattern Detection
Prime numbers are identified by their geometric patterns at three levels:

- **Cycle Patterns**:
  - Positions that are themselves prime numbers (2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13)
  - Positions that form specific angles with the cycle origin
  - Positions that form specific relationships with the system level

- **Metacycle Patterns**:
  - Positions that form specific relationships with the metacycle number
  - Positions that form golden ratio relationships within the metacycle
  - Positions that form specific relationships with the system level

- **System Patterns**:
  - Positions that form specific relationships with the system boundary (99779)
  - Positions that form specific angles in the system
  - Positions that form specific relationships with the golden ratio

### 3. Enhanced Resonance Verification
Resonance is used as a secondary verification mechanism with multiple factors:

- **P-Exponent Resonance**: P^(position-1) resonance as suggested by the user
- **Golden Ratio Resonance**: How closely a number resonates with powers of the golden ratio
- **System Boundary Resonance**: How closely a number resonates with the system boundary
- **Möbius Symmetry Resonance**: How symmetrical a number is under Möbius transformation

These factors are combined with optimized weights to create a final resonance score, which is compared against an adaptive threshold based on the number's magnitude.

### 4. Geometric Visualization
The model includes visualization tools to explore the geometric patterns:

- 3D visualization of prime numbers in geometric space
- Visualization of resonance patterns for prime and non-prime numbers

### 5. Mac M2 Optimization
The implementation is optimized for Mac M2 chips by:

- Using Metal Performance Shaders (MPS) when available
- Structuring computations to take advantage of the M2's unified memory architecture
- Implementing efficient algorithms for geometric pattern detection

## Usage

```python
# Predict if a number is prime using the complete model
is_prime = predict_prime(n, use_resonance=True)

# Predict primes in a range
predicted_primes, actual_primes, true_positives, false_positives, false_negatives = predict_primes_in_range(start, end)

# Predict Fibonacci primes
fibonacci_primes = predict_fibonacci_primes(start_index, count)
```

## Files Included

1. `direct_geometric_pattern_detector.py`: Implements the direct geometric pattern detection approach
2. `enhanced_resonance_verification.py`: Implements the enhanced resonance verification mechanism
3. `complete_geometric_pattern_model.py`: Combines both approaches into a complete model

## Next Steps

1. Further refine the geometric patterns with more sophisticated relationships
2. Explore higher-dimensional representations of the prime number structure
3. Develop interactive visualization tools to explore the patterns in real-time
4. Apply the model to other mathematical sequences beyond Fibonacci
