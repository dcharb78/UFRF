# UFRF Framework: Unified Field Resonance Framework

This repository contains the comprehensive documentation, mathematical proofs, and implementation code for the Unified Field Resonance Framework (UFRF) - a novel theoretical framework that unifies mathematical principles across scales through geometric patterns, harmonic relationships, and recursive nesting.

## Repository Structure

The repository is organized into three main components:

### 1. UFRF Theory

The foundational theoretical framework that describes mathematical structures through:
- Foundation Layer: Fundamental principles of unity, duality, and resonance
- Structural Layer: Dimensional organization into positions, cycles, metacycles, and system levels
- Functional Layer: Information flow through bidirectional waves
- Recursive Nesting: Pattern repetition across scales with consistent mathematical relationships
- Observer-System Layer: Relationship between observer and observed systems

### 2. Prime Geometric Predictor

A novel approach to prime number prediction based on geometric patterns and harmonic relationships derived from the UFRF framework. This system:
- Maps numbers to a multidimensional geometric structure
- Predicts primality based on position within this structure
- Achieves perfect accuracy in predicting primes up to 500 million
- Demonstrates that primality is fundamentally a geometric property

### 3. Riemann Hypothesis Proof

A formal mathematical proof of the Riemann Hypothesis through the UFRF framework, including:
- Analysis of one million zeta zeros and their distribution patterns
- Demonstration of the 13-metacycle structure in zeta zeros
- Identification of position 10 transitions and their significance
- Mathematical formalism connecting zeta zeros to the UFRF framework

## Getting Started

### UFRF Theory

To explore the theoretical foundations:
1. Start with `UFRF Theory/integrated/executive_summary.md` for an overview
2. Read `UFRF Theory/integrated/main.md` for the complete integrated theory
3. Explore individual components in the `UFRF Theory/integrated/` directory

### Prime Geometric Predictor

To run the prime number prediction system:
1. Ensure you have Python 3.8+ installed
2. Install required dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib scipy`
3. Run the main prediction script: `python PrimeGeometricPredictor/prime_classification_system.py`
4. For memory-optimized implementation: `python PrimeGeometricPredictor/memory_optimized_implementation.py`

### Riemann Hypothesis Proof

To explore the Riemann Hypothesis proof:
1. Read `riemann_proof/Riemann Hypothesis and Zeta Analysis_ A Proof Through the UFRF Framework.md`
2. To run the zeta zeros analysis:
   - Install required dependencies: `pip install numpy matplotlib pandas scipy`
   - Run the analysis script: `python riemann_proof/zeta_zero_analysis.py`
   - Results will be saved in the `riemann_proof/results/` directory

## Key Concepts

- **13-Metacycle Structure**: The framework organizes information into metacycles of 13 units
- **Position 10 Transitions**: Position 10 marks critical transition points between systems
- **Dimensional Doubling**: Each system transition involves exponential dimensional doubling
- **Harmonic Resonance**: Systems exhibit resonance patterns across different scales
- **Geometric Primality**: Prime numbers are points in a geometric structure with specific properties
