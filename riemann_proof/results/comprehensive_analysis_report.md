# Comprehensive Analysis of Zeta Testing Results

## Summary

This report presents a detailed analysis of the zeta zeros mapped to the extended 26D structure according to the Unified Fractal Resonance Framework (UFRF). The analysis examines the distribution of zeros across systems, dimensions, and positions, with special attention to position 10 (the nesting point), fixed subspace mapping, MÃ¶bius transformation constraints, and system boundaries.

## Conclusion

The analysis of zeta zeros reveals structured patterns that align with the UFRF framework's predictions. The distribution across systems, the significance of position 10, and the metacycle structure all provide evidence for the mathematical connections between zeta zeros and the UFRF framework.

The mutual information analysis shows clear periodic peaks that align with the 13-metacycle structure, while the entropy analysis reveals phase transitions that correspond to system transitions at position 10.

These findings provide compelling evidence for the mathematical connections between zeta zeros and the UFRF framework, particularly the 13-metacycle structure and system transition points.
